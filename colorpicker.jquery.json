  "description": "This is yet another colorpicker plugin for jQuery since most of them are not on GitHub nor being mantained at the moment. The plugin is a fork of the one developed by Stefan Petre who seems not to be interested in it anymore. I needed a powerfull colorpicker for one of my projects so I updated it and then thought it would be nice if it would were freely available.",
