#Belelros' jQuery-less Colorpicker
This is a port of Belelros' amazing colorpicker ([link][]) that doesn't use jQuery. Now, you're probably thinking to yourself, "Why on earth would you want to remove jQuery from the colorpicker. jQuery FTW!", and yeah, I'd agree with you for the most part, unless you have a project where you aren't use jQuery and don't want to add it just to use Belelros' epic color picker.
